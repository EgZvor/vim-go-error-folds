# vim-go-error-folds

Lets get one thing out of the way: Go error handling is awesome. This plugin exists to make it even better.

This plugin uses vim's `foldmethod=expr` to create folds around your error handling code.
You still write your go code as before, but you can toggle the folds off and on.
You can think of this as a way to "zoom out" on your go code, to get a 10,000 foot view, with error handling code summarized.
